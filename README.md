## Overview

**Smart Road Asset Management System** is designed to:
- Automatically detect and classify road assets (e.g., traffic signs, potholes, barriers) from images.
- Integrate geospatial data with detection results for a comprehensive asset management solution.
- Utilize ZoeDepth for monocular depth estimation, providing depth cues from single images.
- Store and visualize detected assets using QGIS and PostGIS for detailed spatial analysis.
- Provide a user-friendly visualization interface for stakeholders to review asset conditions and plan maintenance activities.

This project leverages state-of-the-art techniques such as deep learning-based object detection, image processing, GIS integration, and advanced depth estimation to address real-world challenges in infrastructure management.

## Features

- **Automated Detection:** Uses advanced object detection algorithms to identify various road assets.
- **Monocular Depth Estimation:** Integrates ZoeDepth to estimate depth from single images.
- **Geospatial Integration:** Combines detection results with geographic data and stores them in PostGIS, enabling robust spatial queries.
- **Visualization:** Uses QGIS for visualizing detected assets and detailed geospatial analysis.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Provides clear visualizations and reports for quick decision-making.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Designed to process large datasets and adaptable to various environments.
