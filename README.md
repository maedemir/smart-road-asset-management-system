# smart-road-asset-management-system-settings

Collecting and managing low-cost and efficient data of road assets such as pedestrian bridges, speed cameras, and similar items is a vital element for the operation, maintenance, and preservation of urban and road management systems. Despite its importance, the current method of collecting road asset data is mostly time-consuming and manual.
The goal of this project is to create an intelligent system for road asset management that can automatically identify road assets and then, visualize them in geographic information system. This system uses the YOLO version 5 object detection model to detect assets present in images across ten different classes. Furthermore, by extracting pixel depth using a depth detection model, the depth of each pixel is obtained, and subsequently, with the help of existing transformations, pixel coordinates can be converted into real-world coordinates. Additionally, this project enables asset visualization by creating a database and utilizing a geographic information system.

Key Words: Asset management, object detection, deep learning, geographic information system (GIS)
